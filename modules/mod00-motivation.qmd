If you've been following the news about the so-called __hurricane season__ over 
the last 10 years or so, chances are you've encountered headlines about some 
years being labeled as "above-average seasons", or "hurricanes becoming stronger", 
or even "the need to add a category 6 to the Saffir-Simpson wind scale".

Below is a small sample of headlines about hurricanes (mostly from the 2024
season) that can serve as motivation for our STAT 199 study this semester.
