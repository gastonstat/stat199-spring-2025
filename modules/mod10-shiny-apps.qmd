Another interesting product to be developed for this project is one or more
shiny apps.


## Ideas

Shiny app to visualize the storm tracks

For instance, say we focus on a particular basin (e.g. North Atlantic):

- widget to choose Season (i.e. Year)

- widget to filter certain category levels (e.g. depressions, storms, hurricanes, etc)

- widget to highlight the track sections above a certain wind speed

- widget to filter month

- widget to increase size of points or width of line based on wind speed
