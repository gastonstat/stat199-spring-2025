title: "3) EDA Single Basin"
---

This module involves a first exploratory analysis of a single basin, e.g. 
North Atlantic (NA) or East Pacific (EP).

The idea is to have a first contact with the data, namely:

- Import data in R
- Import data: only a specific set of columns
- Make sure the data documentation makes sense
    + Are there any discrepancies/inconsistencies between the imported data and
    the codebook?
- In terms of "time", what years are available in the data?
- We plan to focus our analysis since 1980 to present, but should we include other years prior to 1980?
- What are the different types (or classes) of tropical cyclones (terminology):
    + disturbances
    + depressions
    + tropical storms
    + subtropical storms
    + hurricanes (categories 1-5)
    + tropical cyclones
    + subtropical cyclones
    + extratropical cyclones
    

## What to Analyze?

Here are some ideas:

- Start with a given basin, e.g. North Atlantic
- Choose one or two years (or a handful of years?)
  + What might be the most reasonable "oldest" year to work with (e.g. 1950, 1975, 1980)? 
- Perform a univariate exploratory analysis of the following columns (colums 1-16):

    ```
      "SID"
      "SEASON"
      "NUMBER"
      "BASIN"
      "SUBBASIN"
      "NAME"
      "ISO_TIME"
      "NATURE"
      "LAT"
      "LON"
      "WMO_WIND"
      "WMO_PRES"
      "WMO_AGENCY"
      "TRACK_TYPE"
      "DIST2LAND"
      "LANDFALL"
    ```

- Should we derive other variables? (We may need to use `"lubridate"` package)
  + `MONTH`: extract month from `ISO_TIME`
  + `DAY`: extract day from `ISO_TIME`
  + `HOUR`: extract hour from `ISO_TIME`
  + `DURATION`: compute (or summarize) duration of a storm
  + `WIND_KPH`: wind in kilometers-per-hour
  + `CATEGORY`: mutate a category column based on `WIND` speed (category values e.g. -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  + etc
  
- Should we be concerned about missing values?

- What cyclones have names? Is naming consistent with wind scale (i.e. a cyclone is given a name once it reaches "tropical storm" status)?



## Counting Storm Ideas

After getting some degree of familiarity with the data, the next step could 
involve computing distributions (i.e. counting) of the following:

- distribution of Named Storms (e.g. in the North Atlantic, per year),

- distribution of Hurricanes (e.g. in the North Atlantic, per year), 

- distribution of Major Hurricanes (e.g. in the North Atlantic, per year),

__Example 1__: The idea would be to obtain counts more or less similar to the 
graphic displayed in the figure __Atlantic Basin Storm Count__; see 
_Tropical Cyclone Climatology_ webpage <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/" target="_blank">https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/</a>
