Researchers are proposing a Category 6 for winds exceeding 309 km/h, citing 5 storms in this rage since 2013.\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/02/hurricanes-becoming-strong-new-category-6-needed\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is making hurricanes stronger. But it’s unclear if it’s resulting in more of them\n(World Economic Forum)\n\nResearchers now expect more hurricanes to become major storms. But it is unclear how climate change may influence the total number of hurricanes emerging.\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/10/climate-change-impact-tropical-storms\n\n\n\n\nDangerous hurricanes are being made even worse because of climate change, study finds\n(ABC News)\n\nA vast majority of hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 measured stronger winds. According to a study from Climate Central, 84% of Atlantic hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 were, on average, 18 mph stronger because of climate change.\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/dangerous-hurricanes-made-worse-climate-change-study-finds/story?id=116049116\n\n\n\n\nHow unusual has this hurricane season (2024) been?\n(BBC)\n\nIn less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed, which is not far off what the Atlantic would typically get in an entire year.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cden551l7kko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre hurricanes getting worse? Here’s what you need to know\n(Oregon Public Broadcasting)\n\nClimate change has not led to an increase in the total number of hurricanes hitting the U.S. each year. But the storms that do form are more likely to become more intense, with higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and more severe storm surge.\n\nAre hurricanes getting worse?
